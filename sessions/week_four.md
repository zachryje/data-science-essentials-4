## Week 4:

New Topics:

* Reading data from Excel
* `geopandas` and choropleths
  
 Coding tasks:
  
  1. Create a choropleth showing the unemployment rate per county for each Tennessee county.
  2. Create a choropleth showing the SHADAC category for each county (adequate, low inadequate, and moderately inadequate).
  3. After creating the choropleth, you can start working on addressing the first two questions for TN Med Helper described in the project README. There are a few files in the data folder that can be helpful for this:
  * Medicare_Disparities_by_Population - This folder contains data obtained from the [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services](https://data.cms.gov/tools/mapping-medicare-disparities-by-population), as described in the README.
  * County_Health_Rankings - This folder contains the [2020 County Health Rankings](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/).
  * Closures-Database-for-Web.xlsx, which contains a dataset of rural hospital closures, obtained from [UNC's Sheps Center](https://www.shepscenter.unc.edu/programs-projects/rural-health/rural-hospital-closures/).
